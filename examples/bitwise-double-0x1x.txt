; If initial state found a 0, and now finds a 0, we have a pair
; If initial state found a 0 and now finds a 1, the only non-rejecting
; situations are if we are done; we pass to qrb to check. the chars
; 0x and 1x are used as 'marked' 0's and 1's respectively.

; if the character to the right is a blank (the case where our
; input was just '01'), we accept. If it was an 0x or 1x, we need
; to check that there is no extraneous input at the end.

; If we are doing a final pass through the 0x/1x sequence, reject if
; we see a 0 or 1, and accept only if we get through a series of 
; just 0x and 1x chars, and then see a blank.

; If at the beginning we saw a 1, ensure the next character was a 1.
; Otherwise, reject.

; This state is for the middle section of the program, where we want
; to hunt down the '01' segment of the input without changing anything.

; At this state, we have just passed the '01' and need to pass by any
; 0x or 1x chars we have previously written. When we find a 0 or 1, just
; replace it with it's marked equivalent and start going back to the
; beginning of the tape.

; These four states serve similar purposes; first, we are in either qlo1
; or qli1, going backwards through the 0x's and 1x's; we want to ignore 
; them, and when we reach the first 0 or 1, go to a state that is looking
; for them (qlo2 or qli2). These states are going backwards, and if qlo2
; finds an 1x it rejects; if it finds a 0x, it loops back to q0. qli2 does
; the same, but for 0x instead of 1x and vice versa.
